== Welcome to The Metric Tracker

Metric Tracker is a Ruby on Rails application for displaying and interacting with data from
mass spec proteomics experiments.

Initially, the install can be mostly done by running the command 
  
  bundle install

This will require the installation of a dev-kit when running in windows.  Fortunately, there are instructions provided when bundle install fails.  When that has been done, bundle install again.

This also requires R and the R libraries "beanplot" and "Rserve" to be installed.

R can be found at http://www.r-project.org/

If you are unfamiliar with the process of installing R packages, the following two commands, run from R, should suffice to install the packages.

 install.packages('Rserve',,'http://www.rforge.net/')

 and 

 install.packages('beanplot')

Unfortunately, the webserver aspect of this will also require some effort, at least for the best user experience possible.  To that end, it should be achievable by following the directions that are given when you run:

  gem install passenger 

  and

  passenger-install-apache2-module

Honestly, I'm still struggling to get this to work, only because I'm running it together with other web apps on an existing Apache server.  I think it should be doable for simpler installs with relative ease.  If not, I'm unqualified to really help out much.  

One final step appears to be necessary... You'll need to set the location of the database in the database.yml file to match the configuration for each computer.
