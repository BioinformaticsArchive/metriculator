== Welcome to The Metric Tracker

Metric Tracker is a Ruby on Rails application for displaying and interacting with data from
mass spec proteomics experiments.


This requires R and the R libraries "beanplot" and "Rserve" to be installed.

R can be found at http://www.r-project.org/

If you are unfamiliar with the process of installing R packages, the following two commands, run from R, should suffice to install the packages.

 install.packages('Rserve',,'http://www.rforge.net/')

 and 

 install.packages('beanplot')


Unfortunately, the webserver aspect of this will also require some effort, at least for the best user experience possible.  To that end, it should be achievable by following the directions that are given when you run:

  gem install passenger 

  and

  passenger-install-apache2-module
