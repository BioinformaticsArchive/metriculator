== Welcome to The Metric Tracker

Metric Tracker is a Ruby on Rails application for displaying and interacting with data from
mass spec proteomics experiments.


This requires R and the R libraries "beanplot" and "Rserve" to be installed.

R can be found at http://www.r-project.org/

If you are unfamiliar with the process of installing R packages, the following two commands, run from R, should suffice to install the packages.

 install.packages('Rserve',,'http://www.rforge.net/')

 and 

 install.packages('beanplot')
