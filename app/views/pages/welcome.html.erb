<h1>Welcome to Metriculator</h1>
<p>
Here, you'll find a live demo of the Metriculator framework, for performance metric tracking and recording.  This is an archived version of the live framework used in the author's research lab for monitoring, tracking, and automating performance metric generation.

While this site isn't directly plugged into our data acquisition machine in real time, it does contain real values parsed and included from our instrument, as well as some instructive examples demonstrating a comparison between two different ion sources and their associated chromatography settings (flow rates, and run times differed). These are titled CaptiveSpray and NanoSpray and can be viewed in <a href="<%= comparison_path(id: 1) %>">Comparison #1</a>
</p>

<p> In this case, I'll illustrate a few examples where we've seen significant differences outlined and made manifest by an inspection of these plots.
