<li>Metric starter fxnality  # TEST THIS!!</li>
<li>Message Passing # Mostly done, just clean it up!</li>
<li>Cron fxnality can be had by the rufus-scheduler gem, which implements cron stuff in ruby.  Looks pretty easy to use.<br/>

<li>Where do you put the pressure trace files (Public/HPLC/msrun_id/*.svg) ???</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<ul>
<li>Links through the layers</li>
