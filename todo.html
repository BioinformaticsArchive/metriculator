<h3>Archiver</h3>

<ul>
<li>Metric starter fxnality</li>
<li>Message Passing</li>
<li>Cron fxnality can be had by the rufus-scheduler gem, which implements cron stuff in ruby.  Looks pretty easy to use.<br/>
      <code>scheduler = Rufus::Scheduler::PlainScheduler.start_new(:thread_name =&gt; 'my scheduler')</code></li>
<li>EMAIL SMTP ROUTING or I can't test my own email system.</li>

<li>Show the graphs

<ul>
<li>Add breadcrumbs for graph heirarchy?</li>
<li>When to set the symlink? And do we always assume that they are
symlinked into the public/ directory?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alerts should only show up in views if they are marked to show.</li>

</ul>
